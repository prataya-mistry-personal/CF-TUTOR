## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Internet connection (for API calls)

### Dependencies

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd codeforces_tutor
   ```

2. **Run the main application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive prompts:**
   - Enter your Codeforces username when prompted
   - Choose from the main menu options
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions for filtering or analytics

### Menu Options

When you run the application, you'll see:

```

## Question Filtering Guide

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Rating Range:**
   - Enter `800` for no lower bound
   - Enter `3500` for no upper bound
   - Example: `800` to `1200` for beginner problems

2. **Contest Type:**
   - `1` for Educational rounds
   - `2` for Normal Div 2 rounds
   - `3` for Div 1+2 rounds
   - `4` for Div 3 rounds
   - `5` for Div 4 rounds
   - `6` for no preference

3. **Question Position:**
   - Enter `2 5` to consider problems B through E
   - Enter `0` for no preference
   - Enter `4` to consider problem D
   - Uses 1-indexed numbering (A=1, B=2, etc.)

4. **Recent Contests:**
   - Enter number of recent contests to consider (1-500)
   - Example: `50` for last 50 contests

5. **Maximum Results:**
   - Enter maximum number of problem links you want
   - Example: `20` for 20 problems

### Example Output

```
Found 15 problems matching your criteria:
------------------------------------------------------------

## API Information

This application uses the official Codeforces API:
- **Base URL:** `https://codeforces.com/api/`
- **Rate Limit:** 5 requests per second (handled automatically)
- **No authentication required** for the features used

### API Endpoints Used

- `problemset.problems` - Get all problems
- `contest.list` - Get contest information
- `user.info` - Get user basic information
- `user.status` - Get user submissions
- `user.rating` - Get user rating history

## Error Handling

The application handles various error scenarios:
- **Network issues:** Timeout and connection errors
- **Invalid usernames:** User not found errors
- **API limits:** Rate limiting and server errors
- **Input validation:** Invalid user inputs

## Tips for Best Results

### For Question Filtering:
- Start with a broad rating range, then narrow down
- Use recent contests filter for current meta problems
- Educational rounds are great for learning new concepts
- Div 3 and Div 4 are ideal for beginners

### For User Analytics:
- Make sure your Codeforces profile is public
- Use your exact handle (case-sensitive)
- Analytics work best with users who have submissions
- Recent activity helps track improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"User not found" error:**
   - Check spelling of username
   - Ensure username exists on Codeforces
   - Username is case-sensitive

2. **Network timeout:**
   - Check internet connection
   - Codeforces API might be temporarily down
   - Try again after a few minutes

3. **No problems found:**
   - Your filters might be too restrictive
   - Try broadening the rating range
   - Use "no preference" for some filters

4. **Import errors:**
   - Ensure `requests` is installed: `pip install requests`
   - Check Python version (3.6+ required)

## Contributing

This is a simple educational tool. Feel free to:
- Add more filtering options
- Fix the issue with question index selection: for 3 to 5 , question C to question E are considered but there will be problem when index of C1,C2,D1 etc exists.
- Enhance error handling
- Improve the user interface
- Add frontend integration for better user experience
- Add data visualization features
- ML integration for problem suggestion
